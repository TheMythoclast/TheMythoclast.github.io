title: Zapping Antipsychiatry ECT Nonsense
subtitle: What were you the god of again?

One of the favorite targets of the anti-science Antipsychiatry movement is electroconvulsive therapy. ECT is one of the most stigmatized and misunderstood procedures in medicine and the anti-psychiatry movement has been feeding the 
public stigma and misunderstanding of ECT for decades. In Pennsylvania, the anti-psychiatry movement even convinced two state representatives to back a bill that would ban ECT for children. There is no medical evidence that I can
find that shows ECT is unsafe or ineffective for children. However Representative Tom Murt had this to say:

The word controversy to me would imply that there are two equal sides argueing about which side is right. However there are not two equal sides to the issue has there is no real issue to be argued. 
There is one side which has strong evidence and research and the other with dogma and anecdotes. The Antipsychiatry movements rather zealous hatred of ECT is one of the most perplexing things to me when analyzing this particular anti-science movement. ECT is by far one of the safest medical procedures done under anaesthesia with few side effects and strong evidence that it works. ECT has been proven to be very effective at treating a variety of psychiatric conditions that haven't responded to medication. Today I want to look at the Antipsychiatry movement's claims about ECT and see if they hold up to scrutiny. 

ECT Doesn't Cause Brain Damage 

The antipsychiatry movement heavily pushes the idea that ECT causes brain damage. Th
