A video came up in my suggested feed while browsing YouTube today titled "[Stop Worrying About Measles!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxIOw6G2rJ8&t=212s)", by "Dr." Baker. "Dr." Baker is not a real doctor, but chiropractor who has come up in the Z-Pack Tribe Talk Facebook groups many times for his antivaccination videos. There has been measles outbreak in Clark County, Oregon and there have been 36 confirmed cases. However Stephen Baker seems to believe measles isn't a very big deal, his video opens with Mr. Baker asking: "

> Why are you freaking out about measles?!" Measles is ultimately a fever and a rash. 

You know what else is a fever and a rash? Leukemia. Does that mean that leukemia or measles won't kill you? Of course not. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, and it kills thousands of people each year. While most of those deaths are in developing nations without proper access to treatment or the measles vaccine, measles can still cause neurological or respiratory complications that will kill you. [Measles was responsible for 1.2 million deaths in 1985](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdf), and measles killed over 100,000 people in 2016. The measles vaccine has prevented approximately 20 million deaths since 2000. However Baker seems to believe that the measles vaccine will not people who have received the MMR vaccine from the measles. 

> You need to know that your vaccination does not protect you from the measles. Vaccinated people still get measles and vaccinated people still give measles. 

The CDC statistics show that the MMR vaccine does prevent measles, as the measles vaccine has prevented 20 million deaths since 2000. Can you still get measles despite being vaccinated for measles? [Yes, the CDC states that 3 out of every 100 people](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html) will get the measles if exposed to the virus, the reason why is unclear. People who are vaccinated against measles also tend to have a much more mild illness even if they do contract the disease. However that doesn't mean the measles vaccine is ineffective. If everyone is 97% resistant to measles they are less likely to contract it and spread it to others. If enough people get vaccinated and the disease can't spread, [eventually it will just die off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Eradication_of_diseases). This is phenomenon is called herd immunity, which we can achieve through strong vaccination public health campaigns. 

However apparently every doctor is in the pocket of big pharma and this is all a conspiracy to sell parents on getting their children vaccinated. 

> ...and when you're getting scared and you're freaked out by the news. You've gotta understand that this is an awesome marketing campaign. Super awesome marketing campaign. What you'll see is that whenever there is an "outbreak" or somebody gets a disease and they make a big deal about it on the news. It's probably because that particular vaccine has gone down a little bit. Not as many people are using the MMR shot maybe. Oh my it's time for a measles outbreak, we've gotta scare everybody so they can got back to getting their shots.

Are you serious right now? What the fuck? Measles can be deadly, it is highly fucking contagious, and it's completely preventable. Of course people should be freaking out and getting their children vaccinated. That's why the news is making a big deal out of these outbreaks. They're a big deal. In 2004, there was one measles case in the US, last year there was 349 cases of measles, almost triple the amount tripling the number of cases in 2017. But lets talk about this big-vaccine conspiracy angle. Vaccines, especially the measles vaccine, isn't a money maker. Here's the problem, people who receive two doses of the MMR vaccine as children according to the U.S vaccination schedule are considered to be protected for life. 

Now, vaccines sell for a very low amount of money. According to Bourree Lam's article in the *The Atlantic*: "The current CDC pediatric-contract price for MMR is $19.91, while the private-sector pediatric price for MMR has risen to $59.91.". For those of you who don't work in healthcare or have never looked at your insurance payouts, that is NOTHING when it comes to pharmaceutical prices. Your doctor's office would bill you more than 19.91 if the physician assistant came into the room, sneezed on you, and asked you politely, yet firmly, to leave. Pediatricians don't make money from vaccines either, some even take a loss by administering vaccines, and [pediatricians on average receive the lowest amount of money from drug companies](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthy_kids/The-truth-Why-pediatricians-promote-vaccines.html). They really just want to prevent your kid from getting potentially deadly and completely preventable diseases, and maybe someday pay off their med school debt and lease that honda civic they always wanted. Who am I kidding? A pediatrician could never afford to lease a new car! /s



**Let's Talk Numbers** 

> They're gonna try to scare you with numbers. Oh one in a thousand kids dies from measles. Have you done the math and figured out what the percentage is? Your odds are pretty good. 

I'm not great at math however my computer tells me that .1 is still higher than 0. 

> In the United States during the decade prior to the vaccine coming out, there were 4 million children got measles every year and of that 6,000 of them died. So even back before the vaccine there was a .15% chance of your child dying of measles. 

Seriously? Once again, .15% is still a chance your child could die a completely preventable death. For reference 20,360 children died in 2016. If measles was as endemic as it was in 1963 and resulted in death at the same rate, measles would account for the deaths of nearly 7,000 children. Measles would be the leading cause of death of children in the U.S, [exceeding deaths from motor vehicle crashes by nearly 2,000](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2018/12/21/child-death). But don't worry it's just a rash and a fever. 


## Victim Blaming 

> Let's talk about who dies from measles. It's not a healthy child. It's not a healthy adult. It's probably somebody who went to a hospital, a disgusting place full of disease. That spreads more disease than ever. Remember the #3 leading cause of death is you ending up in a hospital. Don't do that. So the people that die of measles are not healthy people. Let's be real clear on that. My definition of health is someone who heals and functions at a high level. Not someone who just doesn't have symptoms. These people who are dying of measles, they're going to the hospital, they already have some other infection, they're probably full of drugs, they've probably been given antibiotics, they probably have zero immune system thanks to their pediatrician, and they're probably sick with some other issue. They get measles, they go to the hospital, mistakes happen, and they die. 

Alright asshole. Let me tell you about the children that die from measles. [The children that die from measles live in developing countries that have low per-capita incomes and weak healthcare infrastructures](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles). They aren't full of drugs, they probably don't even have full bellies. They probably probably don't have antibiotics, nor a pediatrician. I would certainly hope they don't have 'zero immune system', given the reputation of drinking water in developing countries. Malnourished children are much more likely to die from measles or suffer severe complications such as blindness. Fortunately, because of a strong vaccination initiative by the world health organizations the number of measles deaths dropped below 100,000 in a single year for the first time in 2016. Leave it to a guy named Stephen Baker to say the whitest shit I've ever heard. 

But let's talk about who could die from measles if it was endemic in the US as Stephen Baker wants it to be. Infants and people who are immunocompromised such as those with HIV or are undergoing chemotherapy would be incredibly likely to catch measles and die as a result. They would die from measles for absolutely no reason, the measles vaccine is safe and effective at preventing it.


**Stupidity and Selfishness, a Deadly Combination**

> If you're sitting there and saying man "My kids are pretty healthy, my kid squashed a cold in 2 or 3 days. They get a flu and it's gone in a week and a half. Your children are not dying of measles. 

Did you know it's possible to be concerned about the health of other people? Yeah, your kid might not have cancer and getting measles probably wouldn't be life threatening. Guess what? Somebody else's kid has cancer and getting measles would be life threatening. There is no risk to getting the vaccine and you're protecting your kid from getting an illness that could kill them or another child. 

> When your child gets measles, they're better off. There are studies that show people who get measles are less likely to die from heart disease or cancer. 

This claim is utter nonsense. The study he's referencing is utter nonsense and [Skeptical Raptor completely tore it apart](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/measles-infections-prevent-heart-disease-anti-vaccine-trope/#Notes). There is no reason to believe that catching measles would protect you from heart disease or cancer, the studies findings are by chance. Children who get measles are actually worse off as measles can cause [subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)](https://www.encephalitis.info/measles-infection-and-encephalitis). SSPE occurs years after the original measles infection and results in untreatable brain degeneration and death. 



## Vaccines Work

> Here's ultimately what they're trying to do. They're trying to get you to go get vaccinated. 

Yes. We want you to not die from measles. You got us. 

> Since the vaccine came out there's been 457 deaths, like flat out proven. These numbers are very low, because these numbers are from the CDC. The CDC ultimately wants you to get the shot because they probably somehow make money off of that. 

Not-Doctor Baker seems to be getting his information from NVIC, a well known anti-vaccination cult. I searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for all deaths from the MMR and MMRV vaccine and only found 82 events reported. Furthermore, that doesn't mean any of the deaths are "like flat out proven", as the CDC states: *"DISCLAIMER: VAERS staff at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) follow up on all serious adverse event reports to obtain additional medical, laboratory, and/or autopsy records to help understand the circumstances. However, VAERS public data do not generally change based on the information obtained during the follow-up process. There are limitations to VAERS data. A report to VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the adverse event, only that the adverse event occurred sometime after vaccination."*. Even if all of those deaths were the direct result of the vaccine, your risk of dying if everyone was unvaccinated your risk of dying from measles would be tens of thousands of times higher. 

Also, must it be remarked that accusing the CDC as an organization of having a profit motive is pants-on-head level of stupid? Their boss *literally prints money*. 



**Vaccines Don't Cause Autism, Please Stop**

Baker believes that the MMR vaccine causes encephalitis which he believes causes autism. A study in *Pediatrics* looking at the outcomes of over 500,000 children who received the MMR vaccine found that there [was no association between the MMR vaccine encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, or autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12415036). But that won't stop him from claiming that vaccines cause encephalitis, and encephalitis causes autism. 

> Every single autistic child has swelling in the brain, big time. Oh did I say the MMR vaccine causes autism? I don't know, I wouldn't want to go out on a limb there. 

The MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Period. So what does he suggest you do? 



## Conclusion: Delete Your Account For The Kids

Stephen Baker is by far the most smug chiropractor I have ever come across. He has no idea what the fuck he's talking about and his health advice is as dubious and dangerous as it comes. What does he think we should do in regards to measles and vaccinating our children?

> How about this, Mr. Pediatrician, even though you don't know a damn thing about vaccines and you just plug em' full of my kids because the CDC tells you to. Why don't we say "Hey, can I just get the measles vaccine? This outbreak is measles, last I checked there wasn't a mumps outbreak or rubella outbreak. But when you get scared into getting vaccinated you're getting what's called the MMR, the measles, mumps and rubella. Why? Why can't they create a vaccination only for the one thing you want to be protected by? Let's just say I'm freaked out by the measles and I want to get me and my family vaccinated for the measles. Shouldn't I be able to go and just get a measles shot? Not pump my kids full of two other viruses that are not even existent right now? " 

It is you that doesn't know a damn thing about vaccines Mr. Baker. The reason why there isn't just a measles vaccine, is that is serves no purpose. The MMR vaccine is perfectly safe and prevents 3 potentially deadly and completely preventable diseases. Why would we make just a measles vaccine when a measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is clearly better. Stephen Baker is a chiropractor, and chiropractors have no medical training but they often present themselves as doctors give medical advise that they are not qualified to give. Be very skeptical when somebody claims but doesn't state their credentials. If they say they're a doctor and you don't see MD, DO, or MBBS, RUN!!! 

Measles is very contagious, potentially deadly, and easily preventable disease. There is absolutely no reason for a child to catch measles in 2019 in the United States. But because of people like Mr. Baker here on the internet, measles is starting to become a serious public health problem. The MMR vaccine is safe, effective and if someone says otherwise, don't listen to that person has to say ever again. As for you Mr. Baker, protect the children and delete your account.
